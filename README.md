# Computing in ancient Rome

In the old city of Rome, there have been writings that, because of the time of the writing, have been deteriorated. In order to help the cause, the archaelogy and philology of Rome have transcripted the text in `original.txt`.

From the other hand, they have also provided a latin dictionary. Therefore, you, #dailyhackers,must implement a traductor that, given the text and the dictionary, outputs the solution (text corrected).

Good luck!
